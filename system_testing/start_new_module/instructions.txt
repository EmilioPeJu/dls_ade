Originally, the comparison files were created using the generate_comparison_files python script.
Due to a number of issues, such as uneccesary whitespace in the original svn templates, the
folders are now maintained separately. The main addition to each is their expected .gitignore
file, which was obviously not originally present.

The commands used to create the comparison folders using the new script can be seen in the
local_repository_tests.py script, as here they are directly used for comparison.

Note: The testB06/TS module requires the use of the server in order to create the full
repository, as it tests the addition of an App to a previously existing module.
