Instructions for system testing:

Run "make clean && make install" in the repository root.

In this folder, run "source setup_testing_environment.sh" plus three paths as arguments:

1. Path to the bin/ folder of the built python package
2. Path to the .egg folder (not compressed!) to access the modules and scripts
3. Path to the system_testing folder (location of this file), to access system testing code.

eg:

source setup_testing_environment.sh /path/to/dls_ade/prefix/bin /path/to/dls_ade/prefix/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dls_ade-0.0-py2.7.egg /path/to/dls_ade/system_testing

This script will additionally send the repositories located in necessary_server_repos/controlstest.tar.gz to the server, for testing.

Make sure you run the tests in the system_testing/<script_name> folder, using 'nosetests'. For start_new_module, specify a _tests.py file to only run that particular test group.

Note: For start_new_module, if you run remote_repository_tests.py, make sure you commit and push the new number stored in 'repo_test_num.txt'.

More information can be found in the complete documentation (titled 'System Testing Framework').
