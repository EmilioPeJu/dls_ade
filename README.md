# DLS Application Development Environment (ADE)

A collection of scripts used in the DLS Controls Group Application Development Environment.

## Development Environment

Setup a virtualenv in the root of the project and install the dependencies:

```
  virtualenv -p /path/to/your/python2.7 venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install sphinx nose
  
  # Setup the module in development mode
  python setup.py develop
  
  # Optional: Build an egg for distribution
  python setup.py bdist_egg
  
  # Optional: Build the docs with sphinx
  python setup.py build_sphinx
  
  # Optional: Run the unittests with nose
  nosetests
```

## dls-release.py offline testing

To inspect changes to the build server release scripts,
generated by dls-release.py, one can override the location
of the production build server queue by setting environment
variables DLSBUILD_ROOT_DIR and/or DLSBUILD_WIN_ROOT_DIR

```
  # Assuming the above example virtualenv has been configured first

  mkdir -p $HOME/test/work/etc/build/queue
  export DLSBUILD_ROOT_DIR=$HOME/test
  export DLSBUILD_WIN_ROOT_DIR=$HOME/test
  dls-release.py somemodule 1-1dls44

  # Now see and/or run build script in
  # $HOME/test/work/etc/build/queue
```
